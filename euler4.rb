#PROJECT EULER 4
# Description: A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Problem: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# scalable solution since you can enter any range
def largest_palindrome_product(range_begin=100, range_end=999)
max = 0
(range_end).downto(range_begin) do |i|
  (i).downto(range_begin) do |j|
    res = i * j
      if (res.to_s.reverse.to_i == res)
        max = [max,res].max
        break
        #since we are counting down, if res > max, then there would be no point in multiplying i by any values less than the                 current j in the inner loop so we break
      end
    end
  end
  return max

largest_palindrome_product(10,99) # => 9009
